*sum_usr_04.txt*	For Vim version 8.2	Last change: 2022 Jan 05

What I learned:

"3dw" and "d3w" achieve the same result but differ semantically. The former
deletes one word three times, while the latter deletes three words once. If
indifferent, favor the latter style as it is more sensible ("d3w" == delete
three words).

Entering the "o" command in Visual mode jumps the cursor to the other side
(hence, "o") of the text selection area. In Visual blockwise mode, "o" jumps
the cursor between the ends of a diagonal of the selection area; "O" moves the
cursor to the other diagonal in the same line.

Commands in Vim are labeled as "inclusive" or "exclusive." "Inclusive" commands
operate on the character the cursor ends at, while "exclusive" commands do
not.

Three ways of changing text in Vim exist: operator-motion, Visual mode, and
operator-text object. The last method comprises two variants: "i" for "Inner"
and "a" for "A". For example, the "is" command means "Inner Sentence" and "as"
means "A Sentence." The difference between these variants is whether or not
they delete leading and trailing whitespace; the former does not, the latter
does.

Two characters can be swapped with the neat sequence "xp": "x" deletes the
character under the cursor and "p" puts that character after the cursor.
