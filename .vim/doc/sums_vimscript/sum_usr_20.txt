*sum_usr_20.txt*	For Vim version 8.2	Last change: 2022 Jan 07

What I learned:

The command line is the line on which colon commands and search commands are
entered. Press the <BS> (backspace) key (or CTRL-H) to delete the character
before the cursor on the command line. Use navigation keys to traverse the
command line:

	<Left>			one character left
	<Right>			one character right
	<S-Left> or <C-Left>	one word left
	<S-Right> or <C-Right>	one word right
	CTRL-B or <Home>	to begin of command line
	CTRL-E or <End>		to end of command line

<S-Left> is the cursor left key with the Shift key pressed, and <C-Left> is
the cursor left key with the Control key pressed. These keys do not work on
all keyboards, in which case <Left> and <Right> should be used instead.

Delete the word before the cursor with >

	CTRL-W

Delete all characters before the cursor with >

	CTRL-U

Use <Insert> to toggle between inserting (default) and replacing characters.
Cancel a colon or search command with CTRL-C or <Esc>.


All colon commands can be abbreviated. In the help files, a colon command such
as >

	:s[ubstitute]

shows optional characters in brackets. These characters may be specified
partially (e.g., ":su", and ":sub" invoke the ":substitute" command).

Writing the full names of commands in Vim scripts is recommended.

Like colon commands, options also have shorthand versions, but they do not
have optional characters.


Use >

	<Tab>

to complete the word before the cursor when entering a colon command.
Completion is based on context: the words Vim references for completion
depends on the arguments a command accepts. If more than one match was found
when completing a word, press <Tab> again or >

	CTRL-N

to change the word to the next match. Press >

	CTRL-P

for the previous match. Press >

	CTRL-D

for a list of all matches. Complete the word to the longest unambiguous string
with >

	CTRL-L


When entering a colon command, specify a few characters and then press <Up> to
find the most recent colon command that best matches the characters typed.
Unlike most cases, this case does not treat CTRL-P and <Up> equally: CTRL-P
will get the previous colon command regardless of what was typed.

Get the history of all colon command entered with >

	:history

For search commands, use >

	:history /


Open the command line window with >

	q:

This command opens a window containing the command-line history. Press >

	<Enter>

to execute the line under the cursor and close the window. Close the window
without executing anything with >

	:q
