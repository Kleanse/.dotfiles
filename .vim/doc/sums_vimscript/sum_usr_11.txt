*sum_usr_11.txt*	For Vim version 8.2	Last change: 2022 Jan 03

What I learned:

Start Vim with the -r option to attempt recovery of a file:

	vim -r crashed.txt

Specify an empty string for the filename when the file lost was edited without
a name:

	vim -r ""

This command only works when invoked in the same directory as the unnamed file.


Launch Vim with the -r option and no other arguments to get a list of swap
files found by Vim:

	vim -r

Use a specific swap file by specifying it:

	vim -r .specific.txt.swp
