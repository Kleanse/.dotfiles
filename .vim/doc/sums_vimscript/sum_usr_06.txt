*sum_usr_06.txt*	For Vim version 8.2	Last change: 2022 Jan 03

What I learned:

Syntax highlighting allows colored text, which makes reading the file easier.
It can be enabled by invoking the command

	:syntax enable

The command

	:syntax off

disables it for all buffers.

Syntax highlighting is specific to the filetype being edited. Use

	:set filetype

to see the filetype recognized by Vim for the current file.

The command

	:TOhtml

produces a temporary html version of the current file. Saving it and then
opening it with a preferred web browser should display the file as seen in
Vim. (With a dark background set, the file looks ugly by default.)
