*sum_usr_toc.txt*	For Vim version 8.2	Last change: 2022 Jun 07

		       Chapter summaries - by Kenny Lam

The documents listed in this table of contents are modified versions of the
original documents composing the Vim user manual, which is written by Bram
Moolenaar. Specifically, these documents are summaries of their
correspondingly named documents, that is, "sum_usr_04.txt" is a summary of the
original "usr_04.txt" document, "sum_usr_05.txt" a summary of "usr_05.txt",
and so forth. All original material, and more generally the Vim user manual,
can be found in |usr_toc.txt| or at the tag |user-manual|. The works provided
here are NOT endorsed by Bram Moolenaar.

Each summary is intended to be read in a single sitting, from start to end.
Some "summaries" are long, so do not take this suggestion too seriously; split
the summaries into manageable chunks and then apply the suggestion to each
chunk. Without continuity, it is easy to lose your place in these summaries.
Additionally, while reading, try the commands given: just reading the
capabilities and commands of Vim is not enough to learn them.

The summaries do not have section headings, so they are not good references.
Where the original documents begin a new section, however, the summaries show
two blank lines--subtle enough to protect the reader's attention, but also
unique to indicate that the subsequent texts do not quite relate to the
previous ones.
